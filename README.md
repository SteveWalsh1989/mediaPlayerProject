Open button   : allows to open file using devices directory, will only allow files ending in .mp4 to be added
Slower button : cant figure out how to rewind yet so this slows down the rate of play back t0 .75x
Stop button   : stops media which will reset to beginning if started again
Pause button  : pauses media 
Play button   : plays media if paused or stopped, pauses media if playing
Faster button : speeds up rate of play to 2.5x
Exit button   : opens alert window to confirm user wants to close program before stopping program

stackPane as its not fully taking its height and width properties
